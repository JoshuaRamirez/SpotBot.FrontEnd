# Admin App Test Data

This directory contains resources for development of the admin UI.
It includes mock data used by `TestDataInterceptor` to
simulate API responses at the last possible moment before network
requests are sent.

Currently provided mock datasets:

- `users` – example user records
- `accounts` – sample account information
- `encryption-key` – a mock encryption key
- `exchange` – exchange configuration data
- `user-token` – token returned from user credential requests
